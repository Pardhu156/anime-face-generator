## 🧠 Overview

The repository includes code and notebooks for:

- Preprocessing anime face datasets
- Training and fine-tuning generative models
- Generating and visualizing new anime faces
- (Optional) Deploying the model via web interface

## 🚀 Features

- Data pipeline for cleaning and aligning anime face images
- Support for popular architectures like:
  - StyleGAN2
  - DDPM / Diffusion Models
- Sample outputs for easy evaluation
- Tools for image interpolation and latent space exploration
